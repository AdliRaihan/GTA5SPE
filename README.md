## How to install

This mod is not yet detected by RPH, but you can install it anyway, just put in your plugins folder ex: `..\Grand Theft Auto V\plugins\`.
you have to use at least the latest version of RPH, if RPH not updating its version you can check LSPDFR. While in the game open up console `f4` and type `LoadPlugins (my mods).dll`

## Hotkey
  
  `B` : 3rd eye

## Performance

Tested perfectly in old rig with 60+ fps on low graphics, the only thing is suttering is when the first time you load a module, lets say you open up 3rd eye. it'll make your game freeze 0.25s - 1s until the module is loaded but this only happens once. the second time you load the module you won't experience this effect. 

also this depends on your setup.

## Feature 

#### Gameplay Effects

- Fueling system

- jobs (WIP)

#### Jobs 

These jobs are not having any blips, you need to finds the npc by yourself.

- Selling car

  Just steal any car on the street and go to industrial places, there is 1 NPC standing still. turn on your 3rd eye, put the vehicle near the npc and press `G` to sell the car. the prices are random!
  
  **HINT** : Helicopter Cutscenes main mission
- Stealing car

  Go to gas station where you can also wash your car, find the **odd** guy in front of the store. turn on your 3rd eye, press `G` and steal the objective car, go back to gas station. 

  **NOTE** : this mission/car job need $10k, and while you doing this mission after stealing the obj car you'll get chased by police (3 stars). **HINT** : you can't lose the cops just make sure the cops don't see you when you handover the car.

- Hunting
  
  kill any animals, open 3rd eye and press `G`.

I have to change the whole structure for performance purposes, disabling Basic needs because this need inventory first.
